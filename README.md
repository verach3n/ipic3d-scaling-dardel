# Scaling and Performance Profiling of iPIC3D on Dardel

This repository contains a course project conducted as part of **DD2356 ‚Äì Methods in High Performance Computing** at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Spring 2023.

The project evaluates the scalability and performance characteristics of the [iPIC3D](https://github.com/KTH-HPC/iPIC3D) particle-in-cell simulation code, executed on the **Dardel** supercomputer (NAISS Tier-1). The analysis combines scaling experiments, performance profiling, and system-level observations to identify bottlenecks and suggest improvements.

## üìÅ Main Project Directory

üëâ The main content of this work is in the [`project/`](./project) folder. It includes:

- Our **final report** (PDF), summarizing all experiments, results, and conclusions
- Strong and weak scaling experiments using up to 1024 MPI processes
- Performance profiling using CrayPat
- Comparison between **Cray MPICH** and **OpenMPI**
- Analysis of MPI communication overhead and I/O-related runtime imbalance
- Discussion of potential improvements based on observed performance behavior

Other folders in this repo are minor lab assignments from the same course and are not part of this project.
